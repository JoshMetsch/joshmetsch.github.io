                Cover with plastic wrap also sprayed with oil and let it thaw 
                and rise in a warm place which can take anywhere from 3 to 5 
                hours. You can also do this the night before.

            <br>

                In one bowl, combine mozzarella cheese with feta cheese and 
                parmesan. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>

                Spread the zaatar mixture all across and sprinkle the cheese. 
                Tightly roll it up and place on a baking tray lined with 
                parchment paper, seam side down. Repeat with the rest.
