        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12-15 tomatillos (1.5 lbs.)</li>
            <li>3 jalapenos</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>15-20 sprigs cilantro</li>
            <li>2 chipotles in adobo</li>
            <li>3 limes</li>
            <li>5 avocados (or more for larger groups)</li>
            <li>2-3 bags tortilla chips</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Roasting the tomatillos takes the longest so it's best to start 
                with that. De-husk the tomatillos and give them a good rinse. 
                I usually de-stem them as well knowing that any juices leftover 
                in the roasting pan will go in the blender as well. Place them 
                on a baking sheet and roast for <b>20 minutes</b> in the oven at 
                <b>400F.</b>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>For the Guac, start by finely dicing <b>1/4 onion.</b> Smoosh 
                the diced onion with the back of a fork and add it to a mixing 
                bowl along with: the flesh of <b>5 avocados</b>, the juice of 
                <b>2 limes</b>, a heaping <b>teaspoon of salt</b>. Mush and 
                combine well. You are welcome to add some <b>finely diced 
                cilantro or jalapeno</b>, but lately I keep it simple. Take a 
                final taste for seasoning, adding more pinches of salt or lime 
                if you think it needs it. <b>Note:</b> 1/4 teaspoon of salt per 
                avocado is a good starting point to keep in mind if you're using 
                additional avocados.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once the tomatillos are roasted you can start building the 
                Salsas. For the Salsa Verde add the following ingredients to a 
                blender: <b>8-10 roasted tomatillos, 1/2 onion, 2 peeled garlic 
                cloves, 15-20 sprigs cilantro, and 1-2 jalapenos.</b> Combine 
                well and taste for heat. For a milder version, start with only a 
                single jalapeno (or half) and taste test from there, adding more 
                slivers of jalapeno if you want to increase the heat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                For the Tomatillo Chipotle Salsa add the following ingredients 
                to a blender: <b>4-5 roasted tomatillos, 2 peeled garlic cloves, 
                and 1-2 chipotles in adobo.</b> Combine well and taste for heat. 
                For a milder version start with just a single chipotle (or half)
                , adding more from there and taste testing along the way. 
                <b>Note:</b> I usually slice open and scrape out the seeds of 
                the chipotles as they seem to harden over time, but you can 
                consider this optional.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place the Guacamole, Salsa Verde, and Tomatillo Chipotle Salsa 
                in the middle of the table and surround it with tortilla chips. 
                Enjoy!!

            <li>1/2 jalapeno</li>
            <li>1 lime</li>
            <li>15-20 sprigs cilantro</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt (plus more to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For the Refried Beans</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can black beans</li>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 chipotles in adobo</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon adobo sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water (or stock)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you want to make the refried beans start by roughly chopping 
                <b>1/2 an onion</b> and peel <b>2 garlic cloves</b>. Saute the 
                onion and garlic in a glug of oil over <b>medium heat for 5-7 
                minutes</b>.  Drain and rinse <b>one can of black beans</b>. 
                Add the black beans to the onion mixture along with <b>2 
                chipotles in adobo, 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, 1/2 teaspoon cumin
                , 1/2 teaspoon salt, freshly ground black pepper, and 1/2 cup 
                water (or stock)</b>. Simmer for a few minutes until heated 
                through.  Combine the bean mixture in a blender or food 
                processor. Salt to taste.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                If you're making fresh Pico de Gallo start by giving the veggies 
                a good rinse.  Chop up <b>2 tomatoes, 1/2 onion, 1/2 jalapeno, 
                and 15-20 sprigs cilantro</b>.  Add to a mixing bowl along with 
                <b>1/4 teaspoon salt and the juice of 1/2 lime</b>.  Combine 
                well and take a taste for seasoning, adding more salt or lime 
                juice if necessary. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Cut the bread rolls in half and bake them in a <b>400F</b> oven 
                for a few minutes before adding any toppings -- this will help 
                crisp them up.  You can optionally add a layer of butter to each 
                roll.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Top each roll with a layer of beans and shredded cheese.  Bake 
                for <b>3-5 minutes</b> or until the cheese is thoroughly melted.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Top with freshly made Pico de Gallo and serve immediately.  
                Enjoy!

            <li>finely chopped raw onion</li>
            <li>cilantro</li>
            <li>squeeze of lime</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by rinsing and de-stemming the tomatoes. Roast them in a 
                <b>400F</b> oven for <b>20-25 minutes</b> or until you need 
                them.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Wipe off any dusty crevasses on the dried chiles. De-stem and 
                de-seed the chiles, but don't worry about getting rid of every 
                last seed. Roast them in the oven for <b>1-2 minutes</b> or 
                until warm and fragrant. Add the chile pieces to a bowl and 
                cover them with the hottest tap water you've got. Let them 
                reconstitute for <b>20 minutes</b> or so.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Roughly chop <b>1 onion</b> and peel <b>6 garlic cloves</b>. Add 
                a glug of oil to a skillet on <b>medium heat</b> and saute the 
                onions and whole garlic cloves. Once the onion has softened and 
                lightly browned you can add this mixture to the blender.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add a thin layer of oil to a skillet and preheat to 
                <b>medium-high</b>. Chop up the brisket into chunks and give it 
                a good salting. Sear each side of the beef in the skillet for a 
                few minutes or until it is browning. Add the seared meat pieces 
                to the slow cooker. You can optionally deglaze the pan with the 
                <b>2 cups</b> of stock that's used to liquefy the sauce.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Before draining the reconstituted chiles take a taste of the 
                soaking liquid. If it tastes bitter to you then use stock for 
                the sauce. If you like the flavor you are welcome to use the 
                soaking liquid in place of the stock.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the drained chiles, roasted tomatoes, and the onion-garlic 
                mixture to a blender along with: <b>2 cups of stock (or what you 
                    used to deglaze the meat pan), 2 chipotles in adobo 
                    (optional), 1-2 tablespoons adobo sauce from the can 
                    (optional), 1 teaspoon cumin, 2 teaspoons Mexican oregano, 
                    1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, pinch of ground clove, 2 teaspoons 
                    salt, and some freshly cracked black pepper</b>. Combine 
                    well. <b>Note:</b> if you're using stock that's high in 
                    sodium you can consider starting with a single teaspoon of 
                    salt and going from there.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Take a taste of the sauce. An easy to way to add more heat is to 
                add an additional half or whole chipotle. Keep in mind that the 
                sauce has to compete with the big flavor of the beef so I tend 
                to make it salty and fiery at this point.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Cover the seared meat pieces with the sauce. Slow cook on low 
                for <b>4-6 hours</b>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once cooked you can optionally skim off any fat that has risen 
                to the surface. Shred the beef using two forks and discard any 
                fatty chunks that you don't want to eat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the shredded beef (or as much as you are using for tonight's 
                meal) to a separate bowl and add enough sauce to give it a 
                thorough coating. Adding the sauce to the shredded beef is the 
                key so don't skip this step!
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                One serving option is to simply add the shredded beef back to 
                the sauce and serve it soup style -- you may need to thin out 
                the sauce with some stock if you choose this option.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                But I chose tacos for this batch. Add corn tortillas to a dry 
                skillet over <b>medium heat</b> along with slices of cheese. 
                Once the cheese is melted and the underside of the tortillas are 
                forming light brown spots they are ready to go. You can 
                optionally add the meat to the tortillas in the skillet for a 
                quick reheat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                I topped these tacos with Salsa de Aguacate, finely chopped raw 
                onion, freshly chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Store leftover Birria in the fridge where it will keep for a few 
                days.
