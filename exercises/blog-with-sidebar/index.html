                <h1>How Colors Affect the Way We Feel</h1>
                <p>
                    Colors have always been known to influence human psychology. 
                    They can affect mood, emotions, and perceptions in various 
                    ways. The choice or combination of colors can evoke 
                    different emotional responses and associations that help 
                    convey messages and heighten aesthetic appeal, especially 
                    in research and UX/UI design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Color choices are integral in designing products as they 
                    solidify brand recognition and identity. They also play a 
                    vital part in addressing accessibility as sufficient color 
                    contrast and color-coded information can help those with 
                    visual impairments. But which specific colors prompt 
                    positive or negative emotions? Which specific colors 
                    actually impact our mood or even mental health?  
                </p>
                <h3>Colors can evoke positive and negative emotion</h3>
                <p>
                    Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a polymath and writer, was the 
                    first to correlate colors to specific emotional responses in 
                    his book Theory of Colours. He divided colors into two 
                    categories: "plus" and "minus". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "plus" category includes colors that induce positive 
                    feelings such as yellow, red-yellow, and yellow-red.1 Other 
                    studies also show that natural and pastel shades brought a 
                    feeling of calm and softness.1 In particular, the color 
                    green has been seen to alleviate stress and enhance calm 
                    feelings, while people found pale brown to be warm, soft, 
                    and quietly supportive. A soft pale peach color was also 
                    found to be associated with feelings of care, warmth, and 
                    friendliness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, Goethe discusses "minus" colors like 
                    blue, red-blue, and blue-red to induce negative feelings. 
                    Similarly dark colors such as black and gray have cultural 
                    connotations of anxiety and depression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In another study, red in particular was perceived as 
                    eliciting higher arousal and excitement. However, several 
                    mental health studies recommend not placing red alongside 
                    information regarding self-harm. This is vital when it comes 
                    to designing products such as therapeutic apps and websites 
                    for aiding people in distress.

                    Color brightness and saturation influence mood and mental 
                    health
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Color brightness means “how little black is mixed in” while 
                    color saturation means “how little white is mixed in.” A 
                    study of the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) emotion model 
                    by Mehrabian & Russell in 1974 demonstrated that color 
                    brightness can increase pleasure and decrease arousal and 
                    dominance. In this case, pleasure means general positive 
                    and negative feelings experienced, while arousal refers to 
                    the level of alertness and physical activity.10 Dominance, 
                    on the other hand, indicates feelings of control, 
                    non-restriction, and autonomy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to brightness, higher color saturation was found 
                    to increase all three of these domains: pleasure, arousal, 
                    and dominance. This ties in with previous studies 
                    demonstrating that participants perceive joy more in images 
                    that are brighter and more saturated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s understand this better using the example below:
                </p>
                <img 
                    src="images/colorpickerpic.avif" 
                    alt="Brightness and saturation chart"
                    id="img-3"
                >
                <p>
                    If you’re using a blue hue, as in this figure, you might 
                    choose from a variety of brightness and saturation levels, 
                    including
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Light blue (high brightness, low saturation)</li>
                    <li>Azure (high brightness, high saturation)</li>
                    <li>Bluish gray (low brightness, low saturation)</li>
                    <li>Indigo (low brightness, high saturation)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Though each of these is a variant of blue, each elicits 
                    different emotional responses in the viewer. For instance,
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Light blue would be fairly pleasurable but not arousing 
                        or dominant, eliciting a feeling of tranquility
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Azure would be the most pleasurable and somewhat 
                        arousing but not dominant, eliciting a feeling of 
                        amazement or awe
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bluish gray would be the least pleasurable and fairly 
                        neutral for arousal and dominance, eliciting a feeling 
                        of boredom
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Indigo would be the most arousing and dominant but 
                        neutral-positive for pleasure, eliciting more of a 
                        feeling of boldness or antagonism 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Stress has been seen to be subdued by soft blues and greens, 
                    as these colors are reminiscent of nature such as rolling 
                    fields, blooming gardens, soothing rivers, or blue skies. 
                    The calming influence of these two shades found in nature is 
                    commonly implemented in many hospitals and animal healthcare 
                    facilities around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other studies show that purple-blue hues in images were 
                    received positively as they gave a feeling of calm, harmony, 
                    and simplicity, optimal for visual comfort. This is 
                    particularly important for healthcare professionals or 
                    designers who are developing resources for people in 
                    distress.
                </p>

                    While color can have a significant impact on mental health 
                    and well-being, it's important to recognize that individual 
                    responses to color can vary. Cultural and personal factors 
                    may also play a role in how a certain use of colors and 
                    imagery is perceived.
