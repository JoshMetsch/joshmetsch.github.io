                <h1>How Colors Affect the Way We Feel</h1>
                <p>
                    Colors have always been known to influence human psychology. 
                    They can affect mood, emotions, and perceptions in various 
                    ways. The choice or combination of colors can evoke 
                    different emotional responses and associations that help 
                    convey messages and heighten aesthetic appeal, especially 
                    in research and UX/UI design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Color choices are integral in designing products as they 
                    solidify brand recognition and identity. They also play a 
                    vital part in addressing accessibility as sufficient color 
                    contrast and color-coded information can help those with 
                    visual impairments. But which specific colors prompt 
                    positive or negative emotions? Which specific colors 
                    actually impact our mood or even mental health?  
                </p>
                <h3>Colors can evoke positive and negative emotion</h3>
                <p>
                    Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a polymath and writer, was the 
                    first to correlate colors to specific emotional responses in 
                    his book Theory of Colours. He divided colors into two 
                    categories: "plus" and "minus". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "plus" category includes colors that induce positive 
                    feelings such as yellow, red-yellow, and yellow-red.1 Other 
                    studies also show that natural and pastel shades brought a 
                    feeling of calm and softness.1 In particular, the color 
                    green has been seen to alleviate stress and enhance calm 
                    feelings, while people found pale brown to be warm, soft, 
                    and quietly supportive. A soft pale peach color was also 
                    found to be associated with feelings of care, warmth, and 
                    friendliness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, Goethe discusses "minus" colors like 
                    blue, red-blue, and blue-red to induce negative feelings. 
                    Similarly dark colors such as black and gray have cultural 
                    connotations of anxiety and depression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In another study, red in particular was perceived as 
                    eliciting higher arousal and excitement. However, several 
                    mental health studies recommend not placing red alongside 
                    information regarding self-harm. This is vital when it comes 
                    to designing products such as therapeutic apps and websites 
                    for aiding people in distress.
