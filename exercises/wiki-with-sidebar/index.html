                        The company was founded in 1946 by French fashion 
                        designer Christian Dior. Haute couture is under the 
                        Christian Dior Couture division. Delphine Arnault has 
                        been the CEO of Christian Dior Couture since 2023.[8]

                    <p>
                        The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946[9]
                        [5] at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. However, the 
                        current Dior corporation celebrates "1947" as the 
                        opening year.[5] Dior was financially backed by wealthy 
                        businessman Marcel Boussac.[5][10] Boussac had 
                        originally invited Dior to design for Philippe et 
                        Gaston, but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start 
                        under his own name rather than reviving an old brand.
                        [11] The new couture house became a part of "a 
                        vertically integrated textile business" already operated 
                        by Boussac.[10] Its capital was at FFr 6 million and 
                        workforce at 80 employees.[10] The company was really a 
                        vanity project for Boussac and was a "majorly owned 
                        affiliate of Boussac Saint-Freres S.A. Nevertheless, 
                        Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his 
                        namesake label (legal leadership, a non-controlling 
                        stake in the firm, and one-third of pretax profits) 
                        despite Boussac's reputation as a "control freak". 
                        Dior's creativity also negotiated him a good salary.[10]

                    <p>
                        On 12 February 1947, Christian Dior launched his first 
                        fashion collection for Spring–Summer 1947. The show of 
                        "90 models of his first collection on six mannequins" 
                        was presented in the salons of the company's 
                        headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne.[5] Originally, the 
                        two lines were named "Corolle" and "Huit".[5] However, 
                        the new collection went down in fashion history as the 
                        "New Look" after the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar 
                        Carmel Snow exclaimed, "It's such a new look!"[5][10] 
                        The New Look was a revolutionary era for women at the 
                        end of the 1940s.[12] When the collection was presented, 
                        the editor in chief also showed appreciation by saying; 
                        "It's quite a revolution, dear Christian!"[12] The debut 
                        collection of Christian Dior is credited with having 
                        revived the fashion industry of France.[13] Along with 
                        that, the New Look brought back the spirit of haute 
                        couture in France as it was considered glamorous and 
                        young-looking.[14] "We were witness to a revolution in 
                        fashion and to a revolution in showing fashion as well.
                        "[15] The silhouette was characterized by a small, 
                        nipped-in waist and a full skirt falling below mid-calf 
                        length, which emphasized the bust and hips, as 
                        epitomized by the "Bar" suit from the first collection.
                        [16][17] The Bar suit was a contribution from the head 
                        of Dior's tailoring atelier, a young Pierre Cardin, who 
                        was employed by the house from 1947 to 1949.[18] The 
                        collection overall showcased more stereotypically 
                        feminine designs in contrast to the popular fashions of 
                        wartime, with full skirts, tight waists, and soft 
                        shoulders. Dior retained some of the masculine aspects, 
                        as they continued to hold popularity through the early 
                        1940s, but he also wanted to include more feminine 
                        style.[19]The "New Look" became extremely popular, its 
                        full-skirted silhouette influencing other fashion 
                        designers well into the 1950s, and Dior gained a number 
                        of prominent clients from Hollywood, the United States, 
                        and the European aristocracy. As a result, Paris, which 
                        had fallen from its position as the capital of the 
                        fashion world after World War II, regained its 
                        preeminence.[20][21][22] The New Look was welcomed in 
                        western Europe as a refreshing antidote to the 
                        austerity of wartime and de-feminizing uniforms, and was 
                        embraced by stylish women such as Princess Margaret in 
                        the UK.[citation needed] According to Harold Koda, Dior 
                        credited Charles James with inspiring The New Look.[23] 
                        Dior's designs from the "New Look" did not only affect 
                        the designers in the 1950s, but also more recent 
                        designers in the 2000s, including Thom Browne, Miuccia 
                        Prada, and Vivienne Westwood. Dior's evening dresses 
                        from that time are still referred to by many designers, 
                        and they have been seen in different wedding themed 
                        catwalks with multiple layers of fabric building up 
                        below the small waist (Jojo, 2011). Examples include 
                        Vivienne Westwood's Ready-to-Wear Fall/Winter 2011 and 
                        Alexander McQueen's Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 2011 
                        (Jojo, 2011).[citation needed] Not everyone was pleased 
                        with the New Look, however. Some considered the amount 
                        of material to be wasteful, especially after years of 
                        cloth rationing.[24] Feminists in particular were 
                        outraged, feeling that these corseted designs were 
                        restrictive and regressive, and that they took away a 
                        woman's independence.[25] There were several protest 
                        groups against the designs including, the League of 
                        Broke Husbands, made up of 30,000 men who were against 
                        the costs associated with the amount of fabric needed 
                        for such designs. Fellow designer Coco Chanel remarked, 
                        "Only a man who never was intimate with a woman could 
                        design something that uncomfortable."[21] Despite such 
                        protests, the New Look was highly influential, 
                        continuing to inform the work of other designers and 
                        fashion well into the 21st century.[13] For the 60th 
                        anniversary of the New Look in 2007, John Galliano 
                        revisited it for his Spring-Summer collection for Dior.
                        [26] Galliano used the wasp waist and rounded shoulders, 
                        modernised and updated with references to origami and 
                        other Japanese influences.[26] In 2012 Raf Simons 
                        revisited the New Look for his debut haute couture 
                        collection for Dior, wishing to update its ideas for the 
                        21st century in a minimalist but also sensual and sexy 
                        manner.[13][27] Simons's work for Dior retained the 
                        luxurious fabrics and silhouette, but encouraged 
                        self-respect for the woman's body and liberation of 
                        expression.[27] The design process for this collection, 
                        which was produced in only eight weeks, is documented in 
                        Dior and I, presenting Simons's use of technology and 
                        modernist re-interpretations.[28]

                        Available references contradict themselves whether 
                        Christian Dior Parfums was established in 1947 or 1948. 
                        The Dior corporation lists the founding of Christian 
                        Dior Parfums as 1947, with the launch of its first 
                        perfume, Miss Dior.[5] Dior revolutionized the perfumery 
                        industry with the launch of the highly popular Miss Dior 
                        parfum, which was named after Catherine Dior (Christian 
                        Dior's sister).[5] Christian Dior Ltd owned 25%, manager 
                        of Coty perfumes held 35%, and Boussac owned 40% of the 
                        perfume business, headed by Serge Heftler Louiche.[5] 
                        Pierre Cardin was made head of the Dior workshop from 
                        1947 until 1950. In 1948, a New York City Christian Dior 
                        Parfums branch was established—this could be the cause 
                        of establishment-date issue.[5] The modern Dior 
                        corporation also notes that "a luxury ready-to-wear 
                        house is established in New York at the corner of 5th 
                        Avenue and 57th Street, the first of its kind," in 1948.
                        [5] In 1949, the "Diorama" perfume is released and[5] by 
                        1949, the New Look line alone made a profit FFr 12.7 
                        million.[10]

                    <h2 id="sub-h-4">Expansion, and Death of Christian Dior</h2>
                    <p>
                        Expansion from France began by the end of 1949 with the opening of a Christian Dior boutique in New York City. By the end of the year, Dior fashions made up 75% of Paris's fashion exports and 5% of France's total export revenue.[10]
                        In 1949, Douglas Cox from Melbourne, Australia, travelled to Paris to meet with Christian Dior to discuss the possibility of having Dior pieces made for the Australian market. Christian Dior and Douglas Cox signed a contract for Dior to produce original designs and for Douglas Cox to create them in his Flinders Lane workshop.[29] A young Jill Walker, still in her mid teens, was one of the many workers for Douglas Cox, a couture label now in the headlines in Australian newspapers almost daily. Jill would go onto forming a couture legacy in Melbourne with popular labels such as Jinoel and Marti with husband Noel Kemelfield.[30] The agreement between Dior and Douglas Cox really put Australian dressmaking on the global stage, yet ultimately the 60 Dior models proved to be too avant-garde for the conservative Australian taste. Douglas Cox was unable to continue the contract beyond the single 1949 season making these Dior-Cox couture pieces some of the most rare collectors items in Australian couture.[31]
                        In 1950, Jacques Rouët, the general manager of Dior Ltd, devised a licensing program to place the now-renowned name of "Christian Dior" visibly on a variety of luxury goods.[10] It was placed first on neckties[5] and soon was applied to hosiery, furs, hats, gloves, handbags, jewelry, lingerie, and scarves.[10] Members of the French Chamber of Couture denounced it as a degrading action for the haute-couture image. Nevertheless, licensing became a profitable move and began a trend to continue "for decades to come",[10] which all couture houses followed.[5]
                        Also in 1950, Christian Dior was the exclusive designer of Marlene Dietrich's dresses in the Alfred Hitchcock film Stage Fright. In 1951, Dior released his first book, Je Suis Couturier (I am a Couturier) through publishers Editions du Conquistador. Despite the company's strong European following, more than half of its revenue was generated in the United States by this time.[10] Christian Dior Models Limited was created in London in 1952.[5] An agreement was made between the Sydney label House of Youth for Christian Dior New York models.[5] Los Gobelinos in Santiago, Chile, made an agreement with Dior for Christian Dior Paris Haute Couture.[5] The first Dior shoe line was launched in 1953 with the aid of Roger Vivier. The company operated firmly established locations in Mexico, Cuba, Canada, and Italy by the end of 1953.[10] As popularity of Dior goods grew, so did counterfeiting.[10] This illegal business was supported by women who could not afford the luxury goods.
                        By the mid-1950s, the House of Dior operated a well-respected fashion empire.[10] The first Dior boutique was established in 1954 at 9 Conduit Street. In honour of Princess Margaret and the Duchess of Marlborough, a Dior fashion show was held at the Blenheim Palace in 1954 as well. Christian Dior launched more highly successful fashion lines between the years of 1954 and 1957.[10] However, none came as close to the profound effect of the New Look.[10] Dior opened the Grande Boutique on the corner between Avenue Montaigne and Rue François Ier in 1955.[5] The first Dior lipstick was also released in 1955.[5] 100,000 garments had been sold by the time of the company's 10th anniversary in 1956.[10] Actress Ava Gardner had 14 dresses created for her in 1956 by Christian Dior for the Mark Robson film The Little Hut.
                        Christian Dior appeared on the cover of TIME dated 4 March 1957. The designer soon afterwards died from a third heart attack on 24 October 1957.[5][10] The captivating impact of Dior's creative fashion genius earned him recognition as one of history's greatest fashion figures.[10] Kevin Almond for Contemporary Fashion wrote that "by the time Dior died his name had become synonymous with taste and luxury."[10]

                        In 2001, the Dior Homme boutique on 30 Avenue Montaigne 
                        reopened with a new "contemporary masculine concept" 
                        instilled by its designer Hedi Slimane. Slimane used 
                        this concept in the creation of his first Dior Homme 
                        collection.[5] Soon, Dior Homme gained prominent male 
                        clientele including Brad Pitt and Mick Jagger.[10]
                        John Galliano then began to release his own Dior watches 
                        in 2001, beginning with the "Chris 47 Aluminum" line, 
                        marking a new era in Dior watch design. Next, the 
                        "Malice" and "Riva" watches were redesigned with 
                        precious stones to create the "Malice Sparkling" and 
                        "Riva Sparkling" spin-off collections. Inspired by the 
                        Spring-Summer 2002 Ready-to-Wear collection, Dior 
                        released the "Dior 66" watch, breaking many feminine 
                        traditional expectations in design. The Dior flagship

                        "Higher" was released in 2001, followed by the perfume 
                        "Addict" in 2002. The company then opened Milan's first

                        locations were in full operation.[10] On 3 June 2002, 
                        Slimane was presented with the "International Designer 
                        of the Year" award by the CFDA. Until 2002, Kanebo was 
                        the Christian Dior ready-to-wear license holder in Japan 
                        and, when the license expired, Christian Dior was able 
                        to profitable directly sell its ready-to-wear and 
                        accessories in its own boutiques.[38] The "Chris 47 
                        Steel" watch was released in 2003 as a cousin of the 
                        original "Chris 47 Aluminum". Bernard Arnault, Hélène 
                        Mercier-Arnault, and Sidney Toledano witnessed the 
                        opening of the Dior flagship boutique in the Omotesandō 
                        district of Tokyo on 7 December 2003. The second Dior 
                        flagship store was opened in the upscale Ginza shopping 
                        district of Tokyo in 2004.[5] An exclusive Dior Homme 
                        boutique was opened also that year in Paris on Rue 
                        Royale, and it presented the entire Dior Homme 
                        collection. A second Dior Fine Jewelry boutique in 
                        Paris was opened at 8 Place Vendôme.[5] A Christian 
                        Dior boutique was opened in Moscow after the company 
                        took control of licensed operations of its Moscow agent.
                        [5] The designer of Dior Fine Jewelry Victoire de 
                        Castellane launched her own watch named "Le D de Dior" 
                        (French: "The D of Dior"). signifying the entrance of 
                        Dior watches into its collection of fine Jewelry. This 
                        watch was designed for women but made use of many design 
                        features which are typically thought of as masculine. 
                        Slimane next released a watch for the Dior Homme 
                        collection called "Chiffre Rouge." This special watch 
                        included the signature look of Dior Homme: "Watch design 
                        and technology match each other inseparably, to create 
                        the perfect expression of Dior Homme's artistic 
                        excellence and to increase the watchmaking legitimacy of 
                        Dior timepieces." De Castellane then launched her second 
                        line of watches called "La Baby de Dior". The design for 
                        this line was meant to be more feminine with more of a 
                        "jewelry look. The "Miss Dior Chérie" perfume and the 
                        "Dior Homme" fragrance were released in 2005.[5] 
                        Galliano released his "Dior Christal" watches in which 
                        he combined steel and blue sapphires to create a 
                        "creative and innovative collection." Christian Dior 
                        S.A. then celebrated the 13th anniversary of Dior 
                        Watches in 2005, and, in April of that year, its 
                        "Chiffre Rouge" collection was recognized by the World 
                        Watches and Jewelry Show in Basel, Switzerland. Also in 
                        the year, the fashion house also celebrated the 100th 
                        anniversary of the birthday of designer Christian Dior.
                        [5] An exhibition, "Christian Dior: Man of the Century," 
                        was held in the Dior Museum in Granville, Normandy.
                        In 2006, the Dior watch booth was dedicated to the Dior 
                        Canework. This pattern was made by designer Christian 
                        Dior and based on the Napoleon III chairs used in his 
                        fashion shows. In 2007, Kris Van Assche was appointed as 
                        the new artistic director of Dior Homme. Van Assche 
                        presented his first collection later that year.[5] The 
                        60th Anniversary of the founding of the Maison Dior was 
                        officially celebrated in 2007 as well.[5]
                        By February 2011, the House of Dior was in scandal after 
                        accusations of John Galliano making antisemitic remarks 
                        made international headlines: the company found itself 
                        in a "public relations nightmare."[39] Galliano was 
                        fired in March and the scheduled presentation of his 
                        Fall-Winter 2011/2012 ready-to-wear collection went 
                        ahead without him, amid the controversy, on 4 March.[40] 
                        Before the start of the show, chief executive Sydney 
                        Toledano gave a sentimental speech on the values of 
                        Christian Dior and alluded to the family's ties to The 
                        Holocaust.[41] The show closed with the staff of the 
                        atelier coming out to accept applause in the absence of 
                        their artistic director. (The previous January 2011 
                        presentation of Spring-Summer 2011 haute-couture was the 
                        last appearance of Galliano on the Dior runway.) The 
                        company went on ahead and appointed Bill Gaytten as head 
                        designer interim in absence of artistic director.[42] 
                        Gaytten had worked under Galliano for Dior and for the 
                        John Galliano label. The first haute-couture collection 
                        (for the Fall-Winter 2011 season) under Gaytten's 
                        management was presented in July and was received with 
                        mainly negative reviews.[43][44] Meanwhile, speculation 
                        remained for months as it was unknown who would be 
                        selected to replace Galliano. During its 13-month period 
                        of having no artistic director, Dior began undergoing 
                        ubtle changes in its designs as the influence of the 
                        theatrical and flamboyant Galliano faded. The all-new 
                        resigned dior.com was launched in late 2011.
                        There is a subtext to this New New Look that goes beyond 
                        respect for the house's esteemed founder. In one fell 
                        swoop, John Galliano has been all but removed from the 
                        Dior history books. By making a visual connection 
                        between his era and that of Christian Dior himself, Raf 
                        Simons has redrawn the line of succession. The 
                        unimpeachable codes of Dior are illustrated for a new 
                        generation; the bias-cut dresses and Kabuki styling of 
                        Galliano downgraded to a footnote.
                        On 23 January 2012, Gaytten presented his second 
                        haute-couture collection (for the Spring-Summer 2012 
                        season) for Dior and it was much better received than 
                        his first collection.[46]
                        Belgian designer Raf Simons was announced, on 11 April 
                        2012, as the new artistic director of Christian Dior. 
                        Simons was known for his minimalist designs,[45] and 
                        this contrasted against the dramatic previous designs of 
                        Dior under Galliano. Furthermore, Simons was seen to 
                        have emerged as a "dark horse" amid the names of other 
                        designers who were considered high contenders.[39] To 
                        emphasize the appropriate choice of Simons as the right 
                        designer, the company ostentatiously made comparisons 
                        between Simons and the original designer Christian Dior.
                        [47] Reportedly, Bernard Arnault and fellow executives 
                        at Dior and LVMH were keen to move Dior from the 
                        Galliano years.[39] Simons spent much time in the Dior 
                        archives[48] and familiarizing himself with 
                        haute-couture (as he had no previous background in that 
                        niche of fashion).[39] Simons was then scheduled to 
                        debut his designs in July. Meanwhile, Gaytten's Spring-
                        Summer 2012 haute-couture collection was presented as 
                        the first Dior haute-couture show ever to be held in 
                        China on 14 April in Shanghai;[49] and it was a mark of 
                        the company's devotion to its presence in the Chinese 
                        market. Cosmetics counter at New Zealand department 
                        store Smith & Caughey's in Auckland, New Zealand
                        The show was the last presentation by Gaytten for Dior, 
                        and he remained as head designer for the John Galliano 
                        label.[50] On 3 May, the Dior: Secret Garden — 
                        Versailles promotional film was launched.[51] It was 
                        highly buzzed about throughout various industry and 
                        social media sources as it was a display of Dior through 
                        its transition. Simons presented his first-ever 
                        collection for the company — the Fall-Winter 2012 haute-
                        couture collection — on 2 July. A major highlight of the 
                        fall-winter 2012 haute-couture shows,[39][48][52] the 
                        collection was called by the company as "the new 
                        couture" and made reference to the start of a new Dior 
                        through the work of Simons "wiping the [haute couture] 
                        slate clean and starting again from scratch."[53] The 
                        designer's collection "made more references to Mr. Dior 
                        than to the house of Dior"[45] with pieces harkening 
                        back to themes Dior's post-World War II designs 
                        introduced to fashion.[39] Simons, who rarely makes 
                        himself available for interviews, gave an interview 
                        published by the company through its Dior Mag online 
                        feature.[54] While previous runway presentations under 
                        Galliano were held at the Musée Rodin, Simons' show was 
                        held at a private residence, near the Arc de Triomphe, 
                        with the address only disclosed to select top-clients, 
                        celebrities, journalists, and other personnel 
                        exclusively invited in a discreet affair.[55] 
                        High-profile figures in attendance included designers 
                        Azzedine Alaïa,[39][48] Pierre Cardin,[39][56] Alber 
                        Elbaz (Lanvin designer),[39][45][48] Diane von

                        Christopher Kane,[39][45] Olivier Theyskens,[48] 
                        Riccardo Tisci,[39][56] Donatella Versace;[39][45][48]

                        Marion Cotillard,[39] Mélanie Laurent,[39] Jennifer 
                        Lawrence,[39] Sharon Stone; film producer Harvey 
                        Weinstein;[48] and Dior chairman Arnault with his 
                        daughter.[39] Live satellite feed of the show was
                         provided on DiorMag online and Twitter was also 
                         implemented for real time communication.[55] By then, 
                         it was also known that the company had purchased the 
                         Parisian embroidery firm Maison Vermont sometime 
                         earlier in 2012.[45]
                        In March 2015 it was announced that Barbadian singer, 
                        actress and businesswoman Rihanna was chosen as the 
                        official spokeswoman for Dior; this makes her the first 
                        black woman to take the spokeswoman position at Dior.
                        [57] In 2015, Israeli model Sofia Mechetner was chosen 
                        to be the new face of Dior.[58] In 2016, Maria Grazia 
                        Chiuri was named the women's artistic director for Dior.[59]
                        In April 2016 a new Dior flagship boutique opened in San 
                        Francisco, with a party hosted by Jaime King.[60]
                        In 2017, Dior renovated and expanded its Madrid store. 
                        The brand celebrated the opening of the new boutique in 
                        a masked ball attended by a number of Spanish 
                        celebrities like Alejandro Gómez Palomo.[61]
                        In March 2018, Kim Jones was named the men's artistic 
                        director for the house.[62] Under his management Dior 
                        has made several high profile streetwear collaborations. 
                        Jones first show for Dior featured American artist and 
                        designer Brian Donnelly, a.k.a. KAWS. Thereafter 
                        followed collaborations with Raymond Pettibon, 1017 ALYX 
                        9SM, Yoon Ahn, Hajime Sorayama, Daniel Arsham, Sacai and 
                        most recently Shawn Stussy, creator of the legendary 
                        streetwear brand Stüssy.[63] In October 2019, Dior apologized to China for using a map of China that excluded Taiwan.[64]
                        On 11 March 2022, 30 Avenue Montaigne has once again 
                        opened its doors to the public.[65] The property was 
                        closed for two years for a major renovation led by 
                        architect Peter Marino.[65] Historically, 30 Avenue 
                        Montaigne is the place where Christian Dior showcased 
                        his first collection.[65] In January 2023, it was 
                        announced Delphine Arnault would assume the role of 
                        chairperson and CEO, beginning in February.[66]

                    <p>
                        Dior has created strong partnerships with celebrities 
                        and social media influencers, working closely with these 
                        individuals to reach more demographics and re-establish 
                        its identity as a new, modern brand, despite the fact 
                        that it has been around for a while.[67] This has 
                        allowed the brand to portray a more populist image and 
                        attract a wider audience.[68] The brand has worked with 
                        and dressed contemporary style icons like Jennifer 
                        Lawrence and Lupita Nyong'o, who may resonate with 
                        millennials.[69] Dior has effectively implemented social 
                        media into their marketing communication strategy, in 
                        which images and videos from campaigns are shared on 
                        both the official Dior profile, and on the celebrity 
                        ambassadors' social media pages. An example of this 
                        success is seen in the Secret Garden campaign featuring 
                        Rihanna.[70] In this campaign, Rihanna is seen dancing 
                        to a song from her album (Only If For a Night) through a 
                        hall of mirrors.[71] By being associated with Rihanna's 
                        song, the company created a sense of association with 
                        her brand, which was beneficial to the company as she 
                        was ranked as the most marketable celebrity in 2016.[72] 
                        Despite the reach not being completely suitable to the 
                        Dior target audience, collaborating with the likes of 
                        Rihanna allowed the company to engage with more of the 
                        market, as Rihanna's social media following is four 
                        times larger than that of the fashion house.[68]
