                        The company was founded in 1946 by French fashion 
                        designer Christian Dior. Haute couture is under the 
                        Christian Dior Couture division. Delphine Arnault has 
                        been the CEO of Christian Dior Couture since 2023.[8]

                    <h2>Founding</h2>
                    <p>
                        The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946[9]
                        [5] at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. However, the 
                        current Dior corporation celebrates "1947" as the 
                        opening year.[5] Dior was financially backed by wealthy 
                        businessman Marcel Boussac.[5][10] Boussac had 
                        originally invited Dior to design for Philippe et 
                        Gaston, but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start 
                        under his own name rather than reviving an old brand.
                        [11] The new couture house became a part of "a 
                        vertically integrated textile business" already operated 
                        by Boussac.[10] Its capital was at FFr 6 million and 
                        workforce at 80 employees.[10] The company was really a 
                        vanity project for Boussac and was a "majorly owned 
                        affiliate of Boussac Saint-Freres S.A. Nevertheless, 
                        Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his 
                        namesake label (legal leadership, a non-controlling 
                        stake in the firm, and one-third of pretax profits) 
                        despite Boussac's reputation as a "control freak". 
                        Dior's creativity also negotiated him a good salary.[10]

                    <h2>"New Look"</h2>
                    <p>
                        On 12 February 1947, Christian Dior launched his first 
                        fashion collection for Spring–Summer 1947. The show of 
                        "90 models of his first collection on six mannequins" 
                        was presented in the salons of the company's 
                        headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne.[5] Originally, the 
                        two lines were named "Corolle" and "Huit".[5] However, 
                        the new collection went down in fashion history as the 
                        "New Look" after the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar 
                        Carmel Snow exclaimed, "It's such a new look!"[5][10] 
                        The New Look was a revolutionary era for women at the 
                        end of the 1940s.[12] When the collection was presented, 
                        the editor in chief also showed appreciation by saying; 
                        "It's quite a revolution, dear Christian!"[12] The debut 
                        collection of Christian Dior is credited with having 
                        revived the fashion industry of France.[13] Along with 
                        that, the New Look brought back the spirit of haute 
                        couture in France as it was considered glamorous and 
                        young-looking.[14] "We were witness to a revolution in 
                        fashion and to a revolution in showing fashion as well.
                        "[15] The silhouette was characterized by a small, 
                        nipped-in waist and a full skirt falling below mid-calf 
                        length, which emphasized the bust and hips, as 
                        epitomized by the "Bar" suit from the first collection.
                        [16][17] The Bar suit was a contribution from the head 
                        of Dior's tailoring atelier, a young Pierre Cardin, who 
                        was employed by the house from 1947 to 1949.[18] The 
                        collection overall showcased more stereotypically 
                        feminine designs in contrast to the popular fashions of 
                        wartime, with full skirts, tight waists, and soft 
                        shoulders. Dior retained some of the masculine aspects, 
                        as they continued to hold popularity through the early 
                        1940s, but he also wanted to include more feminine 
                        style.[19]The "New Look" became extremely popular, its 
                        full-skirted silhouette influencing other fashion 
                        designers well into the 1950s, and Dior gained a number 
                        of prominent clients from Hollywood, the United States, 
                        and the European aristocracy. As a result, Paris, which 
                        had fallen from its position as the capital of the 
                        fashion world after World War II, regained its 
                        preeminence.[20][21][22] The New Look was welcomed in 
                        western Europe as a refreshing antidote to the 
                        austerity of wartime and de-feminizing uniforms, and was 
                        embraced by stylish women such as Princess Margaret in 
                        the UK.[citation needed] According to Harold Koda, Dior 
                        credited Charles James with inspiring The New Look.[23] 
                        Dior's designs from the "New Look" did not only affect 
                        the designers in the 1950s, but also more recent 
                        designers in the 2000s, including Thom Browne, Miuccia 
                        Prada, and Vivienne Westwood. Dior's evening dresses 
                        from that time are still referred to by many designers, 
                        and they have been seen in different wedding themed 
                        catwalks with multiple layers of fabric building up 
                        below the small waist (Jojo, 2011). Examples include 
                        Vivienne Westwood's Ready-to-Wear Fall/Winter 2011 and 
                        Alexander McQueen's Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 2011 
                        (Jojo, 2011).[citation needed] Not everyone was pleased 
                        with the New Look, however. Some considered the amount 
                        of material to be wasteful, especially after years of 
                        cloth rationing.[24] Feminists in particular were 
                        outraged, feeling that these corseted designs were 
                        restrictive and regressive, and that they took away a 
                        woman's independence.[25] There were several protest 
                        groups against the designs including, the League of 
                        Broke Husbands, made up of 30,000 men who were against 
                        the costs associated with the amount of fabric needed 
                        for such designs. Fellow designer Coco Chanel remarked, 
                        "Only a man who never was intimate with a woman could 
                        design something that uncomfortable."[21] Despite such 
                        protests, the New Look was highly influential, 
                        continuing to inform the work of other designers and 
                        fashion well into the 21st century.[13] For the 60th 
                        anniversary of the New Look in 2007, John Galliano 
                        revisited it for his Spring-Summer collection for Dior.
                        [26] Galliano used the wasp waist and rounded shoulders, 
                        modernised and updated with references to origami and 
                        other Japanese influences.[26] In 2012 Raf Simons 
                        revisited the New Look for his debut haute couture 
                        collection for Dior, wishing to update its ideas for the 
                        21st century in a minimalist but also sensual and sexy 
                        manner.[13][27] Simons's work for Dior retained the 
                        luxurious fabrics and silhouette, but encouraged 
                        self-respect for the woman's body and liberation of 
                        expression.[27] The design process for this collection, 
                        which was produced in only eight weeks, is documented in 
                        Dior and I, presenting Simons's use of technology and 
                        modernist re-interpretations.[28]

                        Available references contradict themselves whether 
                        Christian Dior Parfums was established in 1947 or 1948. 
                        The Dior corporation lists the founding of Christian 
                        Dior Parfums as 1947, with the launch of its first 
                        perfume, Miss Dior.[5] Dior revolutionized the perfumery 
                        industry with the launch of the highly popular Miss Dior 
                        parfum, which was named after Catherine Dior (Christian 
                        Dior's sister).[5] Christian Dior Ltd owned 25%, manager 
                        of Coty perfumes held 35%, and Boussac owned 40% of the 
                        perfume business, headed by Serge Heftler Louiche.[5] 
                        Pierre Cardin was made head of the Dior workshop from 
                        1947 until 1950. In 1948, a New York City Christian Dior 
                        Parfums branch was established—this could be the cause 
                        of establishment-date issue.[5] The modern Dior 
                        corporation also notes that "a luxury ready-to-wear 
                        house is established in New York at the corner of 5th 
                        Avenue and 57th Street, the first of its kind," in 1948.
                        [5] In 1949, the "Diorama" perfume is released and[5] by 
                        1949, the New Look line alone made a profit FFr 12.7 
                        million.[10]
                    </p>
                    <h2>Expansion, and Death of Christian Dior</h2>
                    <p>
                        Expansion from France began by the end of 1949 with the opening of a Christian Dior boutique in New York City. By the end of the year, Dior fashions made up 75% of Paris's fashion exports and 5% of France's total export revenue.[10]
                        In 1949, Douglas Cox from Melbourne, Australia, travelled to Paris to meet with Christian Dior to discuss the possibility of having Dior pieces made for the Australian market. Christian Dior and Douglas Cox signed a contract for Dior to produce original designs and for Douglas Cox to create them in his Flinders Lane workshop.[29] A young Jill Walker, still in her mid teens, was one of the many workers for Douglas Cox, a couture label now in the headlines in Australian newspapers almost daily. Jill would go onto forming a couture legacy in Melbourne with popular labels such as Jinoel and Marti with husband Noel Kemelfield.[30] The agreement between Dior and Douglas Cox really put Australian dressmaking on the global stage, yet ultimately the 60 Dior models proved to be too avant-garde for the conservative Australian taste. Douglas Cox was unable to continue the contract beyond the single 1949 season making these Dior-Cox couture pieces some of the most rare collectors items in Australian couture.[31]
                        In 1950, Jacques Rouët, the general manager of Dior Ltd, devised a licensing program to place the now-renowned name of "Christian Dior" visibly on a variety of luxury goods.[10] It was placed first on neckties[5] and soon was applied to hosiery, furs, hats, gloves, handbags, jewelry, lingerie, and scarves.[10] Members of the French Chamber of Couture denounced it as a degrading action for the haute-couture image. Nevertheless, licensing became a profitable move and began a trend to continue "for decades to come",[10] which all couture houses followed.[5]
                        Also in 1950, Christian Dior was the exclusive designer of Marlene Dietrich's dresses in the Alfred Hitchcock film Stage Fright. In 1951, Dior released his first book, Je Suis Couturier (I am a Couturier) through publishers Editions du Conquistador. Despite the company's strong European following, more than half of its revenue was generated in the United States by this time.[10] Christian Dior Models Limited was created in London in 1952.[5] An agreement was made between the Sydney label House of Youth for Christian Dior New York models.[5] Los Gobelinos in Santiago, Chile, made an agreement with Dior for Christian Dior Paris Haute Couture.[5] The first Dior shoe line was launched in 1953 with the aid of Roger Vivier. The company operated firmly established locations in Mexico, Cuba, Canada, and Italy by the end of 1953.[10] As popularity of Dior goods grew, so did counterfeiting.[10] This illegal business was supported by women who could not afford the luxury goods.
                        By the mid-1950s, the House of Dior operated a well-respected fashion empire.[10] The first Dior boutique was established in 1954 at 9 Conduit Street. In honour of Princess Margaret and the Duchess of Marlborough, a Dior fashion show was held at the Blenheim Palace in 1954 as well. Christian Dior launched more highly successful fashion lines between the years of 1954 and 1957.[10] However, none came as close to the profound effect of the New Look.[10] Dior opened the Grande Boutique on the corner between Avenue Montaigne and Rue François Ier in 1955.[5] The first Dior lipstick was also released in 1955.[5] 100,000 garments had been sold by the time of the company's 10th anniversary in 1956.[10] Actress Ava Gardner had 14 dresses created for her in 1956 by Christian Dior for the Mark Robson film The Little Hut.
                        Christian Dior appeared on the cover of TIME dated 4 March 1957. The designer soon afterwards died from a third heart attack on 24 October 1957.[5][10] The captivating impact of Dior's creative fashion genius earned him recognition as one of history's greatest fashion figures.[10] Kevin Almond for Contemporary Fashion wrote that "by the time Dior died his name had become synonymous with taste and luxury."[10]
